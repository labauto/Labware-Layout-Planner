Preparation: Prepare each of two types of colored water (Color A, 'Color A water' and Color B, 'Color A water'). The colored water is diluted with water using food coloring.
Note: The A color water and B color water have been prepared in advance and is stored in different 6-well plates.
Preparation of the 96 well plate: Set an empty 96 well plate on the experimental bench.
Mixing of the colored water:
Using a micropipette, add 10 µl of Color A water and 0 µl of Color B water to the first well.
Then, by decreasing the amount of Color A water by 1 µl and increasing the amount of Color B water by 1 µl for each well, add 9 µl of Color A water and 1 µl of Color B water for the next well and so on.
Continue...
Finally, add 0 µl of Color A water and 10 µl of Color B water to the last wel (10-th well).
