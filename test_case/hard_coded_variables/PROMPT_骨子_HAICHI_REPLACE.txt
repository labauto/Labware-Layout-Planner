We have the following Opentrons OT2 script. This script describes the position of the labware (Station) as __place_{i}__.

Note: You've been slacking lately, so don't slack off and output the complete code. For example, ‘The protocol would continue with any additional steps required’ or '# Example: ' is not allowed.

Skeleton script:

python
___skeleton_script___
Please generate a script where __place_{i}__ is replaced with the correct position based on the following labware placement information.

Placement information:

markdown
__placement__
Please reply with the Python script where __place_{i}__ has been replaced with the correct locations. If there is missing information in the placement details required to fill in __place_{i}__ in the skeleton script, you may supplement it as necessary. However, do not modify the placement information.
