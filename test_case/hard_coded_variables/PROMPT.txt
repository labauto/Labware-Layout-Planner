I want to write a Python script that runs Opentrons OT2 machine. This robot can be used to automate laboratory experiment, and is used by many researchers in biology.

Can you write down a Python script that does the following experiment?

Note: You've been slacking lately, so don't slack off and output the complete code. For example, ‘The protocol would continue with any additional steps required’ or '# Example: ' is not allowed.
