# Purpose
Conduct the Mahoro experiment as part of the FF paper. This experiment documents the natural language version in order to generate an object list and initial configuration from natural language.

# Available materials (any number of them)
## "labware"
### "name"
- "50 ml tube"
- "6-well plate"
- "1.5 mL tube"

## "init_content"
- "PBS"
- "medium"
- "trypsin"
- "HEK293A cells"

# Plan
## Completed Pre-Work (-2 days)
- HEK293A cells have been seeded into one well of a 6-well plate at a density of 1×10⁵ cells per well and cultured in a CO₂ incubator (37°C, 5%).

## (Day 0)
- Perform microscopic observation to assess the state of the cells, then carry out the following passage procedures:
  1. Prepare PBS (30 mL in a 50 mL tube), medium (30 mL in a 50 mL tube), and trypsin (30 mL in a 50 mL tube).
  2. Heat the PBS and medium in an aluminum bath at 37°C for 15 minutes.
  3. Remove the 6-well plate from the CO₂ incubator and aspirate the medium from the well containing the cells.
  4. Add 2 mL of PBS.
  5. Aspirate and remove the added PBS.
  6. Add 1.5 mL of trypsin and incubate in the CO₂ incubator (37°C, 5%) for 10 minutes.
  7. Add an additional 1.5 mL of medium to the incubated well and pipette to suspend the cells.
  8. In a new 6-well plate, add 2.625 μL of medium to one well.
  9. Add 375 μL of the cell suspension prepared in step (7) to the well from step (8) and tilt the plate to mix.
  10. Place the plate into the CO₂ incubator (37°C, 5%).
  11. Aspirate and discard the cell suspension from the old plate and from the 1.5 mL tube, then dispose of both the plate and the tube.
