## Preparation:
Prepare each of two types of colored water: one's init_content named Color A water and the other's init_content named Color B water. These are made by diluting food coloring with water.
Note: Color A water and Color B water have been prepared in advance and are stored in different 6-well plates.

## Preparation of the 96 well plate:
Place an empty 96 well plate on the experimental bench.

## Mixing of the colored water:
Using a micropipette, add 300 µl of Color A water and 0 µl of Color B water to the first well.
Then, for each subsequent well, decrease the volume of Color A water by 30 µl and increase the volume of Color B water by 30 µl.
For example, in the second well, add 270 µl of Color A water and 30 µl of Color B water, and so on.
Continue this pattern.
Finally, in the 10th well, add 0 µl of Color A water and 300 µl of Color B water.
