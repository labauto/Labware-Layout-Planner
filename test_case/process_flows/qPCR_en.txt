QPCR
Sample prep for measurement using the QuantStudio 6 Pro.
There are 11 samples, and the plan is to test each with 4 primers, each in duplicate.

Input:

Containers for reagents: tubes or plates
11 sample DNAs: 50 μL each
Water: 50 μL
10 μM primer_F: 50 μL
10 μM primer_R: 50 μL
PCR MIX: 1000 μL
96-well PCR plate: 1 plate
Other necessary tubes or plates for liquid mixing
Output:
A 96-well PCR plate containing a mixture of sample DNA, primer, and PCR MIX.

Procedure:

Dispense 221 μL of PCR MIX into 4 separate tubes.
Add 19.5 μL of 10 μM primer_F1-4 to the tubes with PCR MIX.
Add 19.5 μL of 10 μM primer_R1-4 to the tubes with PCR MIX.
Mix the PCR MIX and primers by pipetting.
Apply 5 μL of sample DNA or water to the reaction plate, filling the columns as shown in the plate map below.
Apply 10 μL of the PCR MIX and primer mixture to the reaction plate, filling the rows as shown in the plate map below.
Plate Map: All 96 wells will be used.

S_n = sample_n (There are 11 types of samples this time, from 1 to 11).
NTC = no template control: water = negative control.
P_m = primer set_m: a set of forward and reverse primers. This time, there are 4 sets.
